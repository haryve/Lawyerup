# CareMeez AGENTS.md (Enterprise Edition)

## üéØ Purpose
This document defines the agent architecture for **CareMeez Enterprise**, a modular AI-first healthcare platform. It describes a multi-agent system optimized for speed, safety, patient triage, RAG-based inference, and intelligent routing ‚Äî scalable across India and globally.

CareMeez agents are designed to be **self-improving**, continuously learning from data, feedback, and interactions to optimize performance and accuracy. The goal is to become the **most intelligent, responsive, and safe healthcare AI system** available.

## üîÅ Agent Lifecycle

1. **Triggering**
   - Event-driven (Firestore, Pub/Sub, file upload)
   - Direct HTTP invocation
   - Scheduler-based (cron)

2. **Execution Flow**
   - Load structured memory (if applicable)
   - Run inference: GPT-4, RAG, classifier, or toolchain
   - Log inputs + inference data for retraining
   - Store results + status update to Firestore

3. **Post-processing**
   - Run feedback hook / callback to downstream agent
   - Self-score results based on latency, success, feedback
   - Trigger self-evaluation or correction if confidence low
   - Log performance, tokens, duration

---

## üîå Agent Communication Patterns

- üîÑ **Shared Memory**: via Firestore subcollections (`sessions/{id}/messages`)
- üß† **RAG-enabled agents** pull from medical corpus in Firestore or GCS
- üï∏Ô∏è **Routing/coordination** handled by `routerAgent` or `plannerAgent`
- üí¨ **Streamed Chat**: all chat agents use OpenAI streaming with intermediate `response1` updates
- üîó **Downstream triggers** activate based on status changes or `flags`
- üìä **AutoEval Metrics**: logged per agent for accuracy, safety, and response time

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Compliance

- All agents must:
  - Log all outputs + timestamps
  - Flag unsafe/ambiguous results (score < threshold)
  - Obey role-based access control (RBAC) at Firestore level
- Sensitive decisions (e.g. triage, diagnosis) must be **double validated**:
  - By secondary AI agent
  - Or by human-in-loop doctor when flagged
- Logs are anonymized and retained for AI model retraining

## üìÖ Agent Automation Schedule

| Agent ID              | Frequency       | Method     |
|-----------------------|-----------------|------------|
| `reminderAgent`       | Every 1 hr      | Pub/Sub    |
| `tipAgent`            | Daily at 8 AM   | Pub/Sub    |
| `reputationAgent`     | Nightly         | Scheduler  |
| `availabilityAgent`   | Real-time + Cron| Firestore + Cron |

---

## üîß Developer Checklist for New Agent

1. Create `function-name.js`
2. Add to `index.js`
3. Write test Firestore event or mock
4. Add field: `status`, `response1`, `error`
5. Update AGENTS.md
6. Add to monitoring dashboard (if critical)
7. Register in self-evaluation pipeline (optional)

---

## üß† Prompt Engineering Guidelines

- Always define system context at top:
```json
{"role": "system", "content": "You are a medical assistant for CareMeez..."}
```
- Use few-shot examples for structured output (JSON if possible)
- Limit prompts to ‚â§ 4K tokens. Truncate older memory if needed
- Store top-performing prompts for agent training

---

## üìå Naming & Logs
- Function name = `agentName.js`
- Result must be stored in Firestore with fields:
  - `status`: "success", "error", "in_progress"
  - `response1`: streamed or final result
  - `error`: detailed if failed
- Log `confidenceScore`, `model`, and `durationMs` per call

| Feature              | Description                                             |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Agent-to-Agent Memory| Agents read each other‚Äôs summaries via Firestore memory |
